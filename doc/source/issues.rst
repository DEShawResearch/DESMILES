Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. include documentation for how to compile the documentation
2. sphinx generates lots of warnings about autosummary problems

Code
~~~~

DESMILES has a dependency on an old garden version of fastai.  It would be nice to get rid of it by including the minimal part of the fastai library in a small number of additional modules.


Tests
~~~~~

1. Separate the regression tests from the prechekin tests.
2. include additional tests for the finetuning executables
